# Battleship in the OOP way

## The story

In 2005, scientists discover in the Gliese system (some 23 light years from Earth) an extrasolar planet, which is named Planet G, believed to be the closest planet to Earth having conditions nearly identical to Earth. In 2006, NASA completes the construction of a transmission device in Hawaii that is five times more powerful than any before it, and a program to contact the planet, known as The Beacon Project, begins.

In 2012, YOU are a hothead and disrespectful lieutenant and Tactical Action Officer aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS John Paul Jones, YOU hold the rank of commander and the Commanding Officer of USS Sampson. YOUR ships join the 2012 Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) in Hawaii. During the exercises, five alien spacecraft arrive in response to the NASA signal (no explanation is given as to how these spacecraft cross 23 light years in a matter of hours). Their communications ship collides with a satellite and crashes in Hong Kong, causing heavy casualties and damage while the other four (a mothership and three warships) land in the water near the coast of Hawaii. 

YOU are ordered to investigate. Upon arrival at the indicated location, they discover a massive dormant floating structure. YOU and two crew members, JERZY and JERZY'S BROTHER, are sent to approach the structure in an armed Zodiac.

When YOU touche the structure, it knocks YOU away and generates a massive force field that encloses the Hawaiian Islands, separating the Navy ships from the RIMPAC fleet. The warships emerge from beneath the water and face the Navy ships in a defensive posture. 



Under JERZY'S orders, YOU begin a game of battleship.
